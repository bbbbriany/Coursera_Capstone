# Coursera_Capstone
This capstone project is for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The project aims for explore the relationship between street looks and realestate price distibution in Taipei, Taiwan.
There are 11 districts in Taipei so I use machine learning method 'k-Means' to get clusters and groups in Taipei City.
Want to find the overlap or similarity between these districts.
